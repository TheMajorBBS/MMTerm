*WARNING*     You will need the following to properly run MMTERM:

                     EGA or better graphic card
                          DOS 3.3 OR later

*************************************************************************
What is MMTERM

* MMTERM is an on-line terminal program designed specifically for use in
  playing MajorMUD, the popular BBS door game.
* MMTERM is an interface composed of graphics and sound.

The advantage of using MMTERM is that it is custom designed just for
playing the game. Thus you have a lot of features that your normal
term program like Telemate or QModem can't offer.

To help make learning MMTERM as easy as possible, I've broken the docs
into these files...

!MMT.DOC      This file. Explains what MMTERM is, how to run it, and the
              available features.
!SCRIPT.DOC   Explains MMTERM's script language, so you can start coding
              your own custom macros for use in MMTERM.
!ORDER.FRM    How to register quickly and get in on the extra MMTERM
              features.
!READ.1ST     Some important info you'll need before running MMTERM.

*************************************************************************
Here's What You Get By Registering MMTERM
(please see !ORDER.FRM for more info)

MMTERM is marketed under the shareware concept. It is not a FREE program.
As shareware.. you are granted a right to try MMTERM for a short trial
period (1-2 weeks should be enough to get to know the program well). At the
end of that time you must decide whether to keep the program or delete it.

Here's one way to test whether you should keep the program...
After your trial period go back to playing MM with your regular comm program.
If you find you can still play and enjoy MM with your comm program, then
you don't need MMTERM. But if you find it harder to play and enjoy MM, then
please, register your copy of MMTERM with me. Your registration grants you
a license to keep using the program for all your playing needs.

Besides.. there are many more benefits you'll get by registering...

1) Maps for playing MM. Show secret rooms, location of manholes, location
   of items, location of training rooms, secret paths, and more.

2) Expanded monster database so your "Auto Attack" and "Auto Cast" features
   will work on MORE monsters. The Unregistered version attacks the
   following monsters only:

   Carrion     Filthbug     Acid Slime     Rat       Kobold
   Lashworm    Thug         Orc            Cultist   Zombie

   With the Registered version you get a database of 30 monsters, PLUS
   the ability to add more monster names and/or other players to your
   database (or Hit List as I like to call it!)

3) Auto Heal

4) Open Door - Course you could use the BASH command in MMTERM's script
   language, but this one is so much nicer.. and repeats till the door
   opens or until it senses you aren't strong enough to open it.

4) Your key will get rid of those annoying registration screens and delays
   you get when exiting MMTERM.

To register.. see the ending screen of MMTERM for address. Better yet,
print the !ORDER.FRM file and fill it out now!!

***************************************************************************
How To Start MMTERM

Syntax:  MMTERM DatabaseName

Where "DatabaseName" is a name you have chosen for this database. You must
supply a name. If you don't enter it on the command line, then MMTERM will
ask you for one before it will run. The purpose of the "DatabaseName" is
for those who play in more then one game of MM and thus may have different
characters with different configurations. I usually call my database the
same name as the BBS the game is on. Easy to remember then, which database
goes to which game of MajorMUD.

There are 3 ways to use MMTERM:

1) Offline. MMTERM can be run offline for various things.
  
2) You can use MMTERM to connect to a BBS.

3) You can start MMTERM after you have already connected to the BBS
   using your comm program.

   If you need to use your comm program for logging onto the BBS (in case
   you want/need to do other things on-line like file transfers, etc..)

   You can always Exit/Shell from your comm program (make sure not to drop
   carrier) and then start MMTERM.

   When using this method, make sure your comm program connects to the BBS
   at the same settings you have configured in MMTERM. Simply go to MMTERM's
   F2 menu (do this offline). Jot down the modem settings (baud, port,
   handshaking, etc), and set your comm program to use the same settings.

   Then call your BBS with your comm program. Do your e-mail, file transfers,
   etc.. When ready to play MM, exit your comm without dropping carrier
   (if you are shelling, you should set your comm program to swap itself to
   XMS/EMS), start MMTERM. Play MM.

   When done playing you can log off the BBS while in MMTERM, or exit
   MMTERM and return to your comm program.

   If you decide that after playing MM, you need to get back in your comm
   program, you can do so without having to redial the BBS. Simply exit
   MMTERM and start your comm program WITHOUT sending the modem init string.
   In Telemate, you would use the /O switch to do this.

   FINAL NOTES:
   If you shell to DOS to run MMTERM, or use a hotkey, you'll probably wise
   to configure your comm program to shell itself to EMS/XMS/DISK.

   With this method, I recommend starting MMTERM while you are at your
   BBS's main menu prompt. Make sure if you get a lot of global messages,
   that they are turned off first before starting MMTERM

***************************************************************************
How to use features with Mouse or Keyboard

Previously I explained how to start MMTERM and how to correct any problems
when running it. So this section will focus on how to use the Mouse or
Keyboard to move around in MMTERM.

When using the keyboard, the following keys run the following features:
You can use the mouse to click on these also.
   
   F1   Macros Menu          CTRL-C   Open/Close a capture file
   F2   Config Menu          CTRL-D   Shell to DOS
   F3   View Maps            CTRL-R   Brief room displays
   F4   Auto Heal            CTRL-V   Verbose room displays
   F5   Auto Grab            CTRL-P   MM Help
   F6   Auto Attack          CTRL-O   Open a closed door/gate
   F7   Auto Sneak           CTRL-S   List your Stats
   F8   Auto Search          CTRL-W   List your Wealth
   F9   Auto Cast            CTRL-B   Scrollback buffer
   F10  Auto Hide            CTRL-L   Look
                             CTRL-A   Dial BBS
                             CTRL-I   List your Inventory
                             CTRL-E   Display your Experience points

Besides the above, MMTERM comes with a script language for making macros.
These Macros can be found on the Macro Screen (F1). MMTERM assigns each
macro to a letter. These macros can be run by using the ALT key and the
letter for that macro.

To use a mouse to run the ALT key macros, simply click on the letter
at the top of the MMTERM screen.

                         MOVEMENT KEYS 

As you know MM requires you to type in NW, NE, etc to move around.
This can be slow and tiring (not to mention boring). MMTERM
alleviates this problem by allowing you other choices for moving.

Mouse:  Use the left mouse button to click on the on-screen compass, or
        up/down buttons

Keypad: Use the numeric keypad (make sure Num Lock is off) for moving.

                                N
                         [ 7 ][ 8 ][ 9 ]
                       W [ 4 ]     [ 6 ] E
                         [ 1 ][ 2 ][ 3 ]
                         [ 0 ][ . ]
                          Up  Down

Of course, you can still type in the commands manually at the command line
should you so desire.

***************************************************************************
Features of MMTERM

---------------->>>>>>>>  F1 - MACRO MENU  <<<<<<<<<<--------------------

The Macro Menu displays all the macros you have available to use. You'll
also see a special FLIP button. This allows you to toggle the display of
macros. When you first open the menu you will see a description of your
macros. By using the FLIP button you can display (and edit/add) the macro's
script code.

Your macros are saved in a text file called MMTMACRO.FIL. You can create
these macros off-line or while on-line from within MMTERM.

To create custom macros that MMTERM understands you'll need to use
MMTERM's script language (see !SCRIPT.DOC for complete details).

                        ------------------------
NOTE: While running a macro, should you wish to abort it, simply press the
      <ESC> key. Sometimes, if you coded the macro wrong, you could find
      yourself in an endless loop (you'll know it when the screen stops
      displaying and none of the keys in MMTERM work). Again, press <ESC>
      until you exit from such a loop.
                        ------------------------

The easiest way to create your macros is within MMTERM. However if
you would like to create the MMTMACRO.FIL file off-line in a word processor
the format is as follows:

1) Add a "'" to the beginning of the description line
2) put the description line above the macro line

Not all macros need to be described. Here are some examples of proper format:

EXAMPLE 1 (both macros described):

'casts spell at monster in room
{send cast vine }{}{send %1;}{}
'looks around
{send look;}{}

EXAMPLE 2 (only third macro described):

{send wealth;}{}
{send exp;}{}
'look around
{send look;}{}

If all this is confusing to you, then create your macros and descriptions
in MMTERM. Then Exit MMTERM or Shell to DOS and examine the MMTMACRO.FIL
file to see the format it is created in.

---------->>>>>>>>>>>  F2 - CONFIG MENU <<<<<<<<<<<<------------

Here you can configure MMTERM to work with MajorMUD.
Some things you'll need to configure are:

* Modem Settings for that BBS
Recommended settings...  2400:  2400 baud and NONE for Handshaking
                         14.4:  19200 baud and CTS/RTS Handshaking

* Sound on/off

* Item Alert on/off
When entering a room or area that has an item on ground, this will
display an alert in case you're moving fast or AFK.

* Configure Auto Heal/Cast/Attack
Here you type in the command you want to use for one of the above.
MMTERM will add your name, or the monsters name to the command for
which it is appropriate.

* Configure Auto Grab
This feature picks up all items in every area/room you go into or are in.
Registered users can toggle to between ALL and SELECT. SELECT allows
the player to be selective as to what he/she grabs. Thus useless and
worthless stuff can be bypassed.

------------------>>>>>>>   F3 - SELECT MAP   <<<<<<<<<-------------------

This window displays your available maps and allows you to choose one for
viewing. You can also add your own maps to MMTERM by giving them an
extension of .MAP

* Registered users get a set of maps for MM. New maps will be added as
  future editions of MajorMUD are released with new areas.

You can also redisplay the last map you viewed by hitting <ENTER> when
asked for a map name. This way you don't have to enter the same map
name over and over.

You may find it easier to just print your maps out instead of displaying
them via the F3 button.

------------------>>>>>>>   F5 - AUTO GRAB   <<<<<<<<<-------------------

This feature, by default, will pick up all items in an area. Double press
the F3 key or double click on it.

Can also be left ON to pick up items as you travel around. Just hit the
F3 key once. The button on the screen will be depressed to indicate this
feature is on. This is real handy at those times you die and need to
pick up all your dropped items.

Registered users can be SELECTIVE. This means they can tell MMTERM what
items they are interested in. MMTERM saves and remembers those items.
Whenever Auto Grab is on and you see items in a room/area, it'll grab
only those items of interest to you and leave the worthless stuff.

------------------>>>>>>>>  F6 - AUTO ATTACK  <<<<<<<<<<<-----------------

Use this feature to turn MMTERM's Auto Attack mode on or off. While ON,
MMTERM will locate any monster or player currently in the room or that
enters a room. It will then search your database for a matching name.
If the monster/players name appears on your "Hit List", MMTERM
automatically launches MM's AutoCombat mode.

In this unregistered version, your "Hit List" is built-in with a limited
number of monsters that can be attacked by this feature. Registered users
will get an expanded database (Hit List) of monsters. Registered users
can also add new monsters or players names to the database. Only those
names in the database will be attacked using this feature.

You can use it 2 ways:

1) If monster already in room, then will turn on AutoCombat mode and
   attempt to kill it.
2) If no monster in the room, then the next time you enter a room with a
   monster you will automatically begin to attack it.

SPECIAL NOTES:

While I talk about monsters, you can also use this feature to automatically
attack a hated player in the game. Simply add the players name to your
Hit List (only available to registered users).

Requires FULL Statline for this feature to work. Type STATLINE FULL at the
MM prompt to make sure you are in the correct mode.

---------------->>>>>>>>  F7 - AUTO SNEAK  <<<<<<<<<<-------------

If your character can SNEAK, then use this feature to make your
character sneak.

It is best to sneak before you move into a room with a monster as you
will be able to do greater damage on your first attack. To get this added
advantage, turn on Auto Attack, then turn on Auto Sneak before moving into
a room with a monster.

------------->>>>>>>>   F8 - AUTO SEARCH   <<<<<<<<<<<-------------

This feature will search a room. Double press the F8 key or double
click on it with the left mouse button.

Can also be left ON to search rooms as you enter them when exploring.
Just hit the F8 key once. The button on the screen will be depressed
to indicate this feature is on.

---------------->>>>>>>>  F9 - AUTO CAST  <<<<<<<<<<<------------------

Works the same as F4's Auto Attack (see above) except casts a spell at
the intended victim instead. Can also be used for INVOKING a spell if
your character has those abilities.

Use MMTERM's F2 (Config Menu) to tell MMTERM what spell you wish to use
while Auto Casting.

SPECIAL NOTE:

Requires FULL Statline for this feature to work. Type STATLINE FULL at the
MM prompt to make sure you are in the correct mode.

---------------->>>>>>>>  F10 - AUTO HIDE <<<<<<<<<<<------------------

This feature will hide you in a room. Double press the F10 key or double
click on it with the left mouse button. Or can be left ON with a single
press.

This feature will attempt to hide, then it will look at yourself to
see if you are really hidden. If you are it will say so.. if not,
you may want to run it again.

BTW, in order for it to look at you, you need to have told MMTERM your
alias in the game. If you didn't, or have changed your name somehow, 
you'll need to create a new .CFG file by stating a gamename not already
in use. If the gamename is in use, then delete the gamename.CFG file
and MMTERM will create a new one.

NOTE: "gamename" refers to a name that you give MMTERM when first
starting it. By specifying a gamename, you can create multiple
configuration files (each with a different name). Why multiples?
Well, if you play in more then one game of MM, then you'll need
a .CFG file for each game since each contains info specific to your
character in that game.

----------------->>>>>>>>  <CTRL> KEYS  <<<<<<<<<<<--------------------

In addition to "F" keys, MMTERM has 13 keys assigned for running other
features.

<CTRL> L, S, I, E, AND W  displays your stats and other items of
interest. By using these keys, you can save yourself some typing.

<CTRL> D  will shell you to DOS if needed

<CTRL> B  will display the scrollback buffer in case something you need
to see has already scrolled off the screen.

<CTRL> C  With this you can easily save a playing session to disk in a
          text file. Simply enter the name for the file and MMTERM
          automatically adds an extension of .CAP.

          If the file doesn't exist, it will be created. If a file with
          the same name exists, you will have the option of overwriting
          it (erases old file) or not (in which case the new info is
          added to the end of the old file).

<CTRL> R, and V will switch room displays between Verbose and Brief.
          Verbose is excellent for those times when you are exploring
          new areas as many times you can get tips on what to do in a room
          by reading the room description. Brief is for those areas you
          don't need to read about.

<CTRL> P  This will bring up a menu that will tell you just about
          everything you could want to know about MM. Must be online 
          to run this feature.

<CTRL> O  When you find a door or gate that is closed, use this to open it.
          However, sometimes your character may not be strong enough to
          open a door. In those cases, this feature will attempt to open
          it 7 times. After failing 7 times, this feature will abort.

          * Requires registration to function.

<CTRL> A  Brings up the BBS phone numbers in your dialing list. Useful
          if you want to dial/redial a BBS.
